# K-means_Clustering_Performance_Comparison
Comparison of Clustering Performance for both CPU andÂ GPU

A Benchmark: K-Means Algorithms for Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow-GPU.

The aim is to compare the clustering performances of Scikit-Learn (random, k-means++) and TensorFlow-GPU (k-means++, Tunnel k-means) algorithms by means of their execution times and print them in a comparison matrix by providing corresponding system specs. Since the content of the data is not the focus of this benchmark study, required data sets will be randomly generated.
